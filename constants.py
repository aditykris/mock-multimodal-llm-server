Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, producing glucose and oxygen.
It takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where chlorophyll absorbs sunlight. Using this energy, plants split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen, 
while carbon dioxide from the air is fixed into glucose through a series of reactions known as the Calvin cycle. 
The overall result is the production of glucose (a form of sugar) that plants use for energy, and the release of oxygen as a byproduct. This process is crucial for life on Earth,
as it provides oxygen for animals to breathe and serves as the foundation of the food chain.
